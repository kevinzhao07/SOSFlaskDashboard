  - SVG images of Michigan and their subsequent interactability, tooltips, and cross-hatching were created by [Alex Cao](https://github.com/caocscar).

### Routes and templates are created with Flask
  -  paths and login and authentication behavior coded by [Alex Cao](https://github.com/caocscar).
  -  dashboard paths coded by [Stephanie Choi](https://github.com/choisteph).
